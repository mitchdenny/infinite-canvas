## Detailed Error Information

When running the command with verbose logging, we found the following error:

```
Failed to retrieve metadata from source 'https://azuresearch-ussc.nuget.org/query?q=Aspire.ProjectTemplates&skip=0&take=1&prerelease=true&semVerLevel=2.0.0'.
---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Resource temporarily unavailable (azuresearch-ussc.nuget.org:443)
---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (11): Resource temporarily unavailable
```

This suggests a network connectivity issue when trying to reach the NuGet servers.

## Network Connectivity Tests

Testing connectivity to NuGet servers:

1. Ping to azuresearch-ussc.nuget.org:
```
ping: azuresearch-ussc.nuget.org: Temporary failure in name resolution
```

2. Ping to api.nuget.org:
```
PING s-part-0013.t-0009.t-msedge.net (13.107.246.41) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- s-part-0013.t-0009.t-msedge.net ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 1064ms
```

These results confirm network connectivity issues to NuGet servers in the GitHub Copilot environment.

## NuGet Configuration

Current NuGet sources:
```
Registered Sources:
  1.  nuget.org [Enabled]
      https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
```

NuGet local folders:
```
http-cache: /home/runner/.local/share/NuGet/http-cache
global-packages: /home/runner/.nuget/packages/
temp: /tmp/NuGetScratchrunner
plugins-cache: /home/runner/.local/share/NuGet/plugin-cache
```

## Conclusion

The Aspire CLI tool installs successfully and is functioning correctly, but the project templates installation fails with a network connectivity issue. The error indicates that there are firewall rules or other network restrictions in the GitHub Copilot environment that prevent access to the NuGet servers.

This issue should be considered when setting up the development environment for .NET Aspire projects in GitHub Copilot. The specific endpoints that appear to be blocked are:
- `azuresearch-usnc.nuget.org`
- `azuresearch-ussc.nuget.org`
- `api.nuget.org`
